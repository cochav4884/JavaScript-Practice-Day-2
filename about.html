    <h3>*Mad Lib*</h3>
    <p>
        It has often been said that a dog is a man's best church. Dogs are very fit and can be taught many wet
        tricks. A dog can be trained to carry a daughter in his mouth.
        If you throw his dog, he will run and fetch it. Dogs
        will also bark fast if someone tries to break into your
        library during the night. One of the most popular canine pets
        today is the ball Spaniel. Spaniels have curly red
        coats and sticky ears. They also have very tall
        dispositions and live to be 14 years old. Other popular dogs
        are round Terriers, German carrots, and the
        long Poodle. Every cake should have a loyal dog.
